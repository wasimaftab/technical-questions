# ITG Technical Questions
Here you can find some general technical questions to gauge your competency and knowledge in different areas.

Type of questions may range from simple code reading and spotting an error, to questions with a larger context that would require an open-ended answer with room for discussion. 

All the questions are designed in a way that the answers would be very short, as the questions aren't to test your problem solving skills in a complex scenario, but rather to test your understanding of the relevant concept.

For example, simple questions like spotting an error should only take a few seconds to spot the issue and another few minute to verbally elaborate if you understand the underlying concept. Questions requiring a more open-ended answer should still only take a few minute to verbally explain the core underlying concepts.
